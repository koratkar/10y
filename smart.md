# Ishaan General Intelligence



From Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality:

> "So," Harry Potter said, "how much science do you know exactly? I can do calculus and I know some Bayesian probability theory and decision theory and a lot of cognitive science, and I've read The Feynman Lectures (or volume 1 anyway) and Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases and Language in Thought and Action and Influence: Science and Practice and Rational Choice in an Uncertain World and Godel, Escher, Bach and A Step Farther Out and -"


Reading list:
- [ ] Feynman Lectures
- [ ] Judgment Under Uncertainty
- [x] Bayesian Statistics (using arbital.com)
- [ ] The Beginning of Infinity
- [ ] Influence by Cialdini


The books will be helpful, but not enough!
