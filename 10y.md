# A Plan for 10 Years of Learning and Thought


What I've learned about learning
--------------------------------

I only learn when there is incentive or something I need. I don't learn when I don't have a good reason.
Take other people's motivations when you don't have a good one.

What I need to learn broadly 
--------------------------

- How to learn at high speeds
- Self Experimentation
- Metalearning
- Mining the Self for data and information
- Working in teams and following through
- Mastering my Sleep
- Focusing on one thing at a time

"What we measure, we improve"


Banking on my young-brain plasticity
-----------------------------------

- Learning Music: playing by ear
- Learning Programming: See header 
- Learning Languages: Hindi/Spanish


Music: social reasons
--------------------

- Practice playing by ear everyday (start with easy songs and go up)
- Easy songs: simple melodies
- Harder: chords and complex rhythms


Programming: building the future 
-------------------------------

Important change: Don't buy books anymore, just work on projects

- Assembler: learning how everything works (6 weeks)
- Scheme: higher levels (8 weeks)
- Deep learning (1 month)
- Blockchain (1 month)
- Robotics (1 month)

Projects:
	Assembler: Nand2Tetris Course
	Scheme: SICP
	Deep learning: not yet decided 
	Blockchain: Some basic coin
	Robotics: not yet decided


Languages
---------

Severly bank on full immersion chances and make that notecard for hindi. Do not worry about memorization, I think that's often a waste of time.
