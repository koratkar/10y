# A Plan for 10 Years of Learning and Thought


What I've learned about learning
--------------------------------

I only learn when there is incentive or something I need. I don't learn or do anything when I don't have a good reason.

Create plans to structure what you do. Creating arbitrary things that you decide you want to learn leads to not learning them.
