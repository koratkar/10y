What matters most to a comic artists sucess is not how many comics they draw, but how many different genres they work in. Piano isn't comic books, but the same principle applies.

Genres to get good at (breadth):
- Jazz (improvisation jazz) (useful: Jeremy Siskind book and lessons)
- Clasical (use sheet music)
- Pop 
- Folk music
- Blues

2. Master it
    - Understand the grammar of the piece (chords, sections)
