# How to build piano skills

Core Plan
---------
1. Try classical music (done)
2. Get good at jazz and improvization
3. Get good at Music Theory
4. Generate a wide musical breadth in genres

Genres
------

What matters most to a comic artists sucess is not how many comics they draw, but how many different genres they work in. Piano isn't comic books, but the same principle applies.

Genres to get good at (breadth):
- Jazz (improvisation jazz) (useful: Jeremy Siskind book and lessons)
- Clasical (use sheet music)
- Pop 
- Folk music
- Blues


How to become a good sheet music player
---------------------------------------

1. Print a piece of music
2. Master it
    - Understand the grammar of the piece (chords, sections)
    - Get good a small section of the piece
    - Move to the next
    - Repeat until entire piece is second nature
4. Keep doing this until you have skills

Sheet music skill level aim: La Campanella and ability to sight read
List of some fun songs to master: 

- [x] Sweden (C418)
- [x] FÃ¼r elise
- [ ] Sonata Simple
- [ ] Moonlight Sonata

Update: friendship with sheet music is over. I'm best friends with *jazzzzz lead sheets* now.

Jazz

Resource: Jeremy Siskind

2022-02-02: Jeremy Siskind is awesome, but his books feel like homework. I've read about how Coltrane learned/practiced and its very different than "by the book." All he would do is grab a piece of music, practice it till the sun came back up, keep practicing it, finally master it, then master it in another key. I'm going to replicate him.

Appropriate skill level
---------------------

- Make sure your not trying to play something to hard, or you'll be frustrated
- Find songs at your level or water down others to get there
- Remember to keep building up
- Play music you like
