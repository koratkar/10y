# How to build piano skills

(I will build skill at these in this order)
1. Playing sheet music
2. Improv music
3. Playing by ear

Genre 
-----

What matters most to a comic artists sucess is not how many comics they draw, but how many different genres they work in. Piano isn't comic books, but the same principle applies.

Genres to get good at:
- Jazz (improvisation jazz) (useful: https://www.thejazzpianosite.com/jazz-piano-lessons/)
- Clasical (use sheet music)
- Blues (improvization)
- Rock
- Soul
- House
- Trance 


How to become a good sheet music player
------------------------------------

1. Print a piece of music
2. Master it
    - Memorize a small section of the piece
    - Play it intensely for up to 20min
    - Play another
4. Keep doing that until you have skills
  

Improv 
------

1. Play with the instrument until you make a cool sound
2. Record that sound/lick
3. Add that into a progression and build a narrative


Playing by Ear
---------------

1. Find a song
2. Guess at how to play it
3. Check the notes to see how close you were


Appropriate skill level
---------------------

- Make sure your not trying to play something to hard, or you'll be frustrated
- Find songs at your level or water down others to get there
- Remember to keep building up
