# How to build piano skills

3 components I've found:

1. Playing sheet music
2. Improv music
3. Playing by ear

How to become a good x genre player
------------------------------------

1. Download a piece of music from x genre
2. Master it
    - Memorize a small section of the piece
    - Play it intensely for up to 20min
    - Play another
    - Don't repeat the same small section twice in a day
4. Keep doing that until you have skills
5. What matters to reading is how much you read

Songs to master:
  1. Auf Einer Berg
  2. Sweden C418
  3. FÃ¼r elise
  

Improv 
------

1. Play with the instrument until you make a cool sound
2. Record that sound/lick
3. Add that into a progression and build a narrative


Playing by Ear
---------------

1. Find a song
2. Guess at how to play it
3. Check the notes to see how close you were


Appropriate skill level
---------------------

- Make sure your not trying to play something to hard, or you'll be frustrated
- Find songs at your level or water down others to get there
- Remember to keep building up
